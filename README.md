# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a race condition that can occur when using Firebase's Realtime Database transactions with concurrent updates.  The issue arises when multiple clients attempt to increment a counter simultaneously. The transaction mechanism, while designed for atomicity, doesn't guarantee serial execution. This can lead to inaccurate counter values.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to increment a counter in the Firebase Realtime Database using a transaction.  If multiple clients run this code simultaneously, the counter may not be incremented correctly due to the race condition.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that uses a more robust approach to handle concurrent updates, avoiding the race condition.  This involves using server timestamps to guarantee unique ordering of updates.  The solution demonstrates how to leverage server timestamps to create a more reliable and accurate counter.
