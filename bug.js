The following code snippet demonstrates a potential issue when using Firebase's Realtime Database with transactions and concurrent updates:

```javascript
// Assume 'data' is a reference to a node in your Firebase Realtime Database
data.transaction(function(currentData) {
  if (currentData === null) {
    return { count: 1 };
  } else {
    return { count: currentData.count + 1 };
  }
});
```

This code attempts to increment a counter ('count') using a transaction. However, if multiple clients execute this code concurrently, race conditions can lead to unexpected results. The transaction might overwrite the changes made by another concurrent transaction, causing the counter to not be incremented correctly.
